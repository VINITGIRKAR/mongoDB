Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to set up and use MongoDB with Python in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

🔧 This guide covers:

* Installing MongoDB and mongosh (MongoDB Shell)
* Configuring the environment variable (PATH)
* Installing Python and setting it up in VS Code
* Installing the required Python package (PyMongo)
* Writing and running Python code to interact with MongoDB

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Install MongoDB Community Edition and mongosh

1. Go to the official MongoDB download page:
   👉 [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

2. Download the MSI installer for your operating system (Windows).

3. Run the installer:

   * Choose “Complete” setup.
   * Ensure the following options are checked:

     * Install MongoDB as a Service
     * Install MongoDB Compass (GUI - optional)
     * Install mongosh (MongoDB Shell)

4. Finish the installation.

🔎 After installation, default locations:

* MongoDB binaries: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin
* mongosh: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\mongosh\bin

## 🛠️ Step 2: Add mongosh to System PATH

1. Copy this path (adjust if needed):

   ```
   C:\Program Files\MongoDB\mongosh\bin
   ```

2. Press ⊞ Win + S, type:
   “Environment Variables” → Click “Edit the system environment variables”

3. In the System Properties window → click **Environment Variables…**

4. Under "System variables", find and select **Path** → click **Edit…**

5. Click **New** → paste the path from step 1.

6. Click **OK** in all windows to save.

7. Open a new command prompt (cmd) and type:

   ```
   mongosh
   ```

   If it opens the shell, it's working!

## 🐍 Step 3: Install Python and VS Code

1. Download Python:
   👉 [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Run the installer and **make sure to check** the box:
   ✅ Add Python to PATH

3. Install VS Code from:
   👉 [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

4. Open VS Code → go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X) → install the Python extension by Microsoft.

## 📦 Step 4: Install pymongo in VS Code Terminal

1. Open VS Code → open your Python project folder.

2. Open Terminal (Ctrl + \`) and type:

   ```
   pip install pymongo
   ```

3. Optional: If you're using a virtual environment, activate it first:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install pymongo
   ```

---

## 📄 Step 5: Write Python Code to Interact with MongoDB

Create a file called mongo\_test.py and write the following:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB server (default: localhost:27017)
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

# Create or access a database
db = client["my_database"]

# Create or access a collection
collection = db["users"]

# Insert a document
collection.insert_one({"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"})

# Query and print documents
for doc in collection.find():
    print(doc)
```

---

## ▶️ Step 6: Run the Python File

In VS Code terminal:

```bash
python mongo_test.py
```

If all is working correctly, it should insert a document and print it from the MongoDB collection.

---

## 🧪 Optional: Interact via mongosh

Open a terminal or command prompt:

```bash
mongosh
```

Inside mongosh:

```js
use my_database
db.users.find()
```

You’ll see the document added via Python.

✅ You're all set! Now MongoDB is fully integrated with Python in VS Code.

Would you like me to generate a sample VS Code project folder structure as a template?
