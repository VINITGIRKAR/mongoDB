### Success! The MongoDB Relational Migrator is Running ðŸŽ‰

From your logs, the service has started successfully on port **8080**. Here's what you should do next:

---

### **1. Access the Web Interface**
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
You should see the MongoDB Relational Migrator web UI.

---

### **2. Key Points from the Logs**
- **Spring Boot** started successfully (v3.4.5)
- **Tomcat** is running on port 8080
- **Active profiles**: `unattended`, `embedded`, `prod`
- **Warning**: Credentials are stored in-memory (not persisted)

---

### **3. Persistent Data Storage**
Your data will be saved in:
```
/home/neural/Migrator
```
*(This was set via `MIGRATOR_PATH_DATA`)*

---

### **4. To Stop the Container**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running, or use:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml down
```

---

### **5. If You Need to Restart**
Just run the same command again:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml up migrator
```
(It will reuse your existing data in `/home/neural/Migrator`)

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **If you can't access port 8080**:
   - Check if another service is using the port:
     ```bash
     sudo lsof -i :8080
     ```
   - Or change the port mapping in your YAML file:
     ```yaml
     ports:
       - "9090:8080"  # Now access via http://localhost:9090
     ```

2. **To view logs later**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml logs
   ```

Let me know if you need help with the migrator tool itself! The hard part (Docker setup) is now done âœ…
