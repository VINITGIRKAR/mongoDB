### Success! The MongoDB Relational Migrator is Running ðŸŽ‰

From your logs, the service has started successfully on port **8080**. Here's what you should do next:

---

### **1. Access the Web Interface**
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
You should see the MongoDB Relational Migrator web UI.

---

### **2. Key Points from the Logs**
- **Spring Boot** started successfully (v3.4.5)
- **Tomcat** is running on port 8080
- **Active profiles**: `unattended`, `embedded`, `prod`
- **Warning**: Credentials are stored in-memory (not persisted)

---

### **3. Persistent Data Storage**
Your data will be saved in:
```
/home/neural/Migrator
```
*(This was set via `MIGRATOR_PATH_DATA`)*

---

### **4. To Stop the Container**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running, or use:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml down
```

---

### **5. If You Need to Restart**
Just run the same command again:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml up migrator
```
(It will reuse your existing data in `/home/neural/Migrator`)

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips**
1. **If you can't access port 8080**:
   - Check if another service is using the port:
     ```bash
     sudo lsof -i :8080
     ```
   - Or change the port mapping in your YAML file:
     ```yaml
     ports:
       - "9090:8080"  # Now access via http://localhost:9090
     ```

2. **To view logs later**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml logs
   ```

Let me know if you need help with the migrator tool itself! The hard part (Docker setup) is now done âœ…

Great! Since your MongoDB Relational Migrator is now running successfully on `http://localhost:8080`, here are your next steps:

---

### **1. Access the Migrator Dashboard**
Open your browser and navigate to:  
ðŸ‘‰ **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**  
You should see the MongoDB Relational Migrator interface.

---

### **2. Key Features to Try**
1. **Connect to Source Database**  
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
2. **Configure Migration Jobs**  
   - Schema analysis, data mapping, and validation.
3. **Run Test Migrations**  
   - Verify data integrity before full migration.

---

### **3. Important Notes**
- **Data Persistence**: Your migration data is stored in `/home/neural/Migrator` (set via `MIGRATOR_PATH_DATA`).
- **Credentials Warning**: The logs show credentials are in-memory. For production, configure secure storage.

---

### **4. Common Commands**
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml stop` | Stop the container |
| `docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml start` | Restart a stopped container |
| `docker compose -f docker-compose-migrator-local.yml down` | Remove the container (keeps data) |

---

### **5. Need Help?**
- **Stuck on a migration step?** Share the error/output.
- **Want to automate?** Ask about CLI/API options.
- **Scaling up?** I can guide you on Kubernetes deployment.
